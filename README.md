# Atlas

**An agentic executive assistant that plans before it acts, remembers what it learns, and reflects after every task.**

Everything it knows about you lives in a SQLite file on your own disk.

Most assistants are a single model call wrapped in a prompt. Atlas is a small society of agents with a memory. A request doesn't just hit a model — it flows through a cognitive loop: a **planner** decides what's needed, relevant **memories** and **skills** are retrieved, the **Atlas** agent acts with a full toolbelt, and afterwards a **reflection** pass decides whether anything durable was learned and writes it down.

The result is an assistant that gets sharper the more you use it — backed entirely by a local database that never leaves your machine.

---

## Your data never leaves your machine

This is the part most assistants get wrong. Atlas has no server-side account, no cloud database, and no sync. Your conversations, the lessons it draws from them, and the vectors it searches them by are all rows in a SQLite file you can open, inspect, back up, or delete.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph local["🖥️  Your machine"]
        direction TB
        DB[("atlas.db — SQLite + sqlite-vec")]
        S["Sessions & messages"]
        E["Experiences"]
        M["Memories & embeddings"]
        K["Skills (SKILL.md)"]
        S --- DB
        E --- DB
        M --- DB
        K --- DB
    end

    P["Prompt text for this one request"]
    API["☁️ Model API"]

    DB --> P
    P --> API
    API -->|"response"| DB

    classDef localBox fill:#0F172A,stroke:#2DD4BF,stroke-width:2px,color:#E2E8F0
    classDef cloudBox fill:#1E1B4B,stroke:#818CF8,stroke-width:2px,color:#E2E8F0
    class DB,S,E,M,K localBox
    class API,P cloudBox
```

The only thing that crosses the network is the prompt for the request you just made. Nothing is retained remotely, because there is nowhere remote to retain it.

**The trade-off, stated honestly:** Atlas is single-tenant and only runs while your machine does. Background reflection and any future scheduled work happen when the process is up, not around the clock. Cloud sync and proactive scheduling are v2 — and the intent is a thin relay for scheduling and notifications, with the data staying local.

---

## The shape of a request

Everything routes through one endpoint — `POST /chat`. The interesting part is what happens in between. This pipeline lives in [`apps/server/src/routes/chat.ts`](apps/server/src/routes/chat.ts):

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Q["POST /chat — query, sessionId?"] --> T["<b>1 · Title & session</b><br/>derive a title, resume or create<br/>a session, persist the user turn"]
    T --> O["<b>2 · Optimize the query</b><br/>rewrite a vague request into<br/>a sharp, unambiguous prompt"]
    O --> P["<b>3 · Plan</b><br/>the Planner decides which<br/>resources this task actually needs"]
    P --> D{"needs what?"}

    D -->|plan| PL["inject the plan"]
    D -->|memory| ME["semantic search<br/>over past memories"]
    D -->|skills| SK["load matching<br/>SKILL.md playbooks"]
    D -->|nothing| NA["skip retrieval"]

    A["<b>4 · Act</b> — the Atlas agent<br/>web · email · calendar · MCP · sub-agents"]

    PL --> A
    ME --> A
    SK --> A
    NA --> A

    A --> R["response returned to the caller"]
    A -.->|"fire and forget"| RF["<b>5 · Reflect & remember</b>"]

    classDef step fill:#1E293B,stroke:#38BDF8,stroke-width:2px,color:#E2E8F0
    classDef act fill:#312E81,stroke:#818CF8,stroke-width:3px,color:#E2E8F0
    classDef reflect fill:#134E4A,stroke:#2DD4BF,stroke-width:2px,color:#E2E8F0
    class T,O,P,PL,ME,SK,NA step
    class A act
    class RF reflect
```

Steps 3–4 mean Atlas only pays for planning, retrieval, and skill-loading when the task warrants it. Step 5 runs *after* the response is sent, so reflection never costs the caller latency.

---

## The reflection loop

This is why Atlas improves over time, and it is the part worth understanding.

After every task, a reflection agent sees what was asked and what happened, and decides whether anything durable was learned. **Most of the time the answer is no** — and that judgement is the whole feature.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["Atlas completes<br/>a task"] --> B["Experience logged<br/>task · result · outcome"]
    B --> C["Reflection agent<br/>distills a lesson"]
    C --> D{"worth<br/>remembering?"}
    D -->|"no — trivia, one-off,<br/>self-contained"| X["logged, not stored"]
    D -->|"yes"| M["embedded into<br/>vec_memories"]
    M --> S["retrieved by similarity<br/>on a future request"]
    S --> A

    classDef flow fill:#1E293B,stroke:#38BDF8,stroke-width:2px,color:#E2E8F0
    classDef keep fill:#134E4A,stroke:#2DD4BF,stroke-width:3px,color:#E2E8F0
    classDef drop fill:#3F1D38,stroke:#F472B6,stroke-width:2px,color:#E2E8F0
    class A,B,C,S flow
    class M keep
    class X drop
```

Retrieval returns the *k* nearest neighbours regardless of quality. If every interaction became a memory, "what's 2+2" would compete for retrieval slots with "prefers short emails, signs off as Soubhik" — and the assistant would get **noisier** with use, not sharper. So the reflection agent returns `worthRemembering: false` for anything self-contained, and only genuine lessons are embedded.

What survives is written to be read out of context, since it will surface next to a future conversation that has nothing to do with the one that produced it:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Stored** | `Prefers very short emails and always signs off as Soubhik. Their manager is Priya.` |
| **Not stored** | `Self-contained arithmetic question; no durable preference or tool behaviour was learned.` |

Each memory carries a `category` (`user`, `project`, `workflow`, `tool`, `fact`), an `importance`, and a `confidence` the agent assigns itself.

---

## Sub-agents

Long or messy work gets delegated. `createSubAgents` spawns a sandboxed agent in its own isolated workspace, with no memory of the calling conversation — only its final result comes back, so intermediate tool calls never clutter the main thread.

| Persona | Capabilities | For |
|---|---|---|
| **`general`** | shell · filesystem · memory · compaction | Broad multi-step work: research, planning, drafting, anything combining several tools |
| **`researcher`** | memory · compaction *(read-only)* | Web research and synthesis across sources. No file or shell access, by construction |

Because Atlas runs on your machine, `general` having shell access is the same trust model as any local dev tool — it is your machine, running your task. This is also precisely why hosting Atlas multi-tenant is not a small change, and part of why it stays local-first.

> **Not available on Bun + Windows.** The sandbox writes workspace files using numeric
> file-open flags, which Bun rejects on Windows — the same call works under Node on
> Windows, and on macOS and Linux. Atlas detects this at startup, leaves the tool
> unregistered, and says so in Settings rather than failing mid-task. See
> [docs/subagents.md](docs/subagents.md).

## What Atlas can do today

- **Web research** — quick search, single-page scraping, and deep multi-step agentic research via [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev)
- **Email** — read, draft, and send through **Gmail**, connected as a hosted [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server via [Pipedream](https://pipedream.com)
- **Calendar** — create and manage **Google Calendar** events, also over MCP
- **Tool discovery** — enumerate an app's available MCP actions on the fly, before acting
- **Sub-agents** — delegate to a sandboxed `general` or `researcher` agent
- **Persistent memory** — sessions, messages, experiences, and semantically-searchable memories, all in local SQLite
- **Skills** — reusable `SKILL.md` playbooks the planner pulls in for specialised tasks, synced from disk on every boot

## The agents

| Agent | Model | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Atlas** | `gpt-5.5` | The executive assistant. Holds the full toolbelt and produces the user-facing answer. |
| **Planner** | `gpt-5.6-luna` | Runs first. Returns a structured decision: is a plan / memory / skills needed, plus the plan text and skill list. Never answers the user. |
| **Reflection** | `gpt-5.4-mini` | Runs after, in the background. Decides whether a durable lesson exists and writes it as a categorised memory. |

The server makes two direct model calls of its own — a title generator (`gpt-5.4-nano`) and a query optimizer (`gpt-5.6-luna`). Sub-agents run on `gpt-5.4`. Embeddings are `text-embedding-3-small` (1536-dim). Model IDs are set per-agent in their source files and are trivial to swap.

## Architecture

A [Bun](https://bun.sh) + [Turborepo](https://turborepo.dev) monorepo. Three pieces do the real work.

### The memory model

| Table | Holds |
|---|---|
| `sessions` | One conversation — title, timestamps |
| `messages` | Every user and agent turn, in order |
| `experiences` | A whole solved task: what was asked, what happened, the reflection drawn from it |
| `memories` | Distilled reusable lessons, with category, importance and confidence |
| `vec_memories` | The `sqlite-vec` shadow table — 1536-dim embeddings, keyed to `memories.id` |
| `skills` | Registry of `SKILL.md` playbooks on disk, synced at boot |
| `jobs` | Background work (currently reflection runs), for retry and debugging |

`memories` and `vec_memories` are written and deleted as a pair — nothing cascades into a virtual table automatically.

## Getting started

You'll need [Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.3+ and an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aizen2006/Atlas.git
cd Atlas
bun install
```

Create `.env` in the repo root with a single line:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

Then:

```bash
bun run atlas
```

That builds the web UI on first run, starts the server, and opens your browser. The
database schema is created automatically — there is no migration step.

Full configuration, optional keys, and troubleshooting: **[docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md)**.

---

## Project status

Atlas is a working prototype under active development. What's real, and what isn't:

**Working** — the full plan → retrieve → act → reflect pipeline, semantic memory with quality gating, skill sync and loading, sub-agent delegation, web research, Gmail/Calendar over MCP.

**Not yet** —

- `POST /chat/stream` is an empty stub. `runAgentStream` exists and works but isn't wired to a route, so responses arrive all at once after the full pipeline completes.
- No interface. `POST /chat` via curl is the only way in — the `atlas` CLI and local web UI are the next milestone.
- Single-tenant by design. `PIPEDREAM_USER_ID` is one hardcoded external user; connections are not per-user.
- `packages/ui/` is untouched `create-turbo` scaffold that nothing imports.
- Sub-agents don't run on Bun + Windows — not because the sandbox is Unix-only, but
  because Bun on Windows rejects the numeric file-open flags it uses (Node on Windows
  handles them fine). Detected at startup and surfaced in Settings; everything else works.
